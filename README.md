Exit code meanings:
2: Roccat swarm is already installed.
3: Nothing to uninstall here.
else: crashes or something that probably never ocurr.

README:
This peace of code i made, is just for show. it dosent actually install something.
but it is still something doing:
Creating empty files in /home/%homepath%/Roccat_Swarm_x64/
So i dosent happen anything bad to your PC when you delete the folder.
so feel free about this!
